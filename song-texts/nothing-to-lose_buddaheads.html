        Well, I was lonely - and I was blue,<br/>
        thought I was born for - being a fool,<br/>
        didn't know anything - of what life's supposed to be,<br/>
        I didn’t know too much - till the lord gave the blues to me!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I've got something, - always by my side,<br/>
        heals all my worries, - relieves my pain inside,<br/>
        so, there's no - use in cryin', - no wonderin' 'bout the truth,<br/>
        I process - all my anger - by playin' the blues!

        It gives me somethin’, - which means a world to me,<br/>
        when life's got me blind, - it pushes me up to see,<br/>
        you see, I can't - help myself, - I'm not beggin' for a change,<br/>
        I just keep - playin' that thing, - in its open range!
